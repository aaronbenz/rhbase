###Intro
Hello, and welcome to a brief introduction to HBase by way of R. This tutourial is aimed at explaining how you can use R through the rhbase package. However, it will use my little custom addition to rhbase which is geared towards using tidyr principals and data.tables/data.frames. Other differences include:

1. Standardized rowkey serializer (raw data type)
2. sz and usz functions only apply to the actual data instead of rowkey
3. hb.put - wrapper around hb.insert for easier inputting
4. hb.pull - wrapper around hb.scan for easier retrieval

So what will you get out of this? Good question. It is broken down into three parts:

1. Getting HBase, Thrift, and rhbase installed and working + breif intro + data intro
2. Inserting Data into HBase + HBase Basic Design/Modelling 
3. Retrieving Data from HBase, doing calculations, and inserting calculations

###IDK My BFF HBase???
Hopefully you have some knowledge of what HBase is, because after all, you are reading this. By no means will I attempt to explain all of HBase, but here is a brief attempt to summarize the mammoth:

**Wikipedias definition**: HBase is an open source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's BigTable and written in Java. It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed Filesystem), providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.

1. Part of the **Hadoop Ecosystem**. A full implementation relies on HDFS, Zookeeper, and your HBase region master(s)
2. A **NoSQL Columnar Database**
  - To RDBMS minds and a like, its best to think of HBase (and NoSQL Columnar in general) as an ultimate 1 way indexing tool (aka no kind of reverse indexing here). 
  - First there is a HBase **table**, which is exactly what you would think it is... a table
  - Within a table are **column families**, which is basically just a subgroup of your table. Best practice is to limit the number and size of these, so if you are new to HBase, just pretend you only have 1 as in most cases that is all that is neccessary. 
  - All data is then accessed via a **rowkey**, which is essentially your indexing mechanism (enter rowkey or range of rowkeys, and BLAM, data)
  - Within a given row, there can be potentially millions of columns. This is the concept of **wide rows**. Although it can certainly be used for many things, time-series data is a good use case as it allows you to store a time values as column values, and then the variable value in a cell (the variable name would be in the row key). This concept is often hard to grasp the first time, so I have provided some visuals to help explain it. Many people's breakthrough on this concept is often when they realize that values are/can be stored as columns. 
  - Schemaless. You do not need to add columns in advance ever, you can simply do it on the fly. However, is advised that you keep record of how you are storing data as the actual retrieval will be made very difficult if you have no idea whats in there.
3. Data modeling: **Based off query patterns and stored directly**. Cross-table joins are a BAD thing (Spark can help with this). Essentially you are sacrificing complex querying for huge speed gains.

So hopefully that helped, and if not, there is plenty of information out there about HBase and what it does. Here are a few links:

- [Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/)
- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HBase)
- [Hortonworks](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hbase/)

###Installing HBase and rhbase
In order to use this stuff, you have to install HBase, thrift (yes, sorry, it uses thrift), and the rhbase. The basic instructions are found [here](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki/user-rhbase-Home), but if you are trying to get up and running as soon as possible, here are a few helpful hints:

1. Install Thrift following this [guide](http://thrift.apache.org/docs/install/)
2. Update PKG_CONFIG_PATH: export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
3. Verifiy pkg-config path is correct: pkg-config --cflags thrift , returns: -I/usr/local/include/thrift
4. Copy Thrift library sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libthrift-0.8.0.so /usr/lib/ 
5. Install HBase following Apache's quickstart [guide](http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#quickstart)
6. Start up HBase and Thrift
```
[hbase-root]/bin/start-hbase.sh
[hbase-root]/bin/hbase thrift start
```
7. Now download and install that baby with devtools (or get a tarball copy [here](https://github.com/aaronbenz/rhbase/tree/master/pkg)

###Test it out
Hopefully you were able to install rhbase. Provided that you were, try out this code to make sure it works. 
```{r}
require(rhbase)
hb.init()
```

###Understanding Our Fake Data
The fake data that is being supplied is time-series data taken from airport support vehicles (like a baggage truck) from various airports over a small period of time. The data is stored hierarchically as: Airport_Day_VehicleIDNum_Variable. You can retrieve a list of all of the data simply by loading it from the rhbase package:
```{r}
require(rhbase)
data(baggage_trucks)
str(baggage_trucks[1:3])
```

The three variables are ***gear***, ***speed*** (mph), and **rpm** (revolutions per minute of engine). With these varibles, we are going to calculate the fuel rate of a vehicle. For more information about the data use `?baggage_trucks`

#Getting Data Into HBase with R
Ok, now its time to talk about actually putting some stuffing in the elephant. 

###HBase Table Design
Its important that we design our HBase table in a way that suites our query pattern. A NoSQL Columnar frame of mind is always ***Design Your Tables For Your Query Pattern***. Unlike a relational store, each table that is built is designed for normally 1 single type of query pattern (When pairing with Document Stores that can essentially do your backwards indexing like Solr or Elastic Search, this makes your data modelling experience "simplier" in concept). This frame of mind implies that:

  * Should never be doing joins (Spark does add some additional capability for this)
  * Avoid lookups as much as possible
  * Do all data transformations on the incoming stream versus the outgoing
  
Remember, the goal is to get the data out and delivered as soon as possible, so make sure that the data and the query patterns are designed for the end format, not the raw format.

Ok, now that my little rant is over with (don't worry, I'll mention this again later :)), lets get to the design of this HBase table. We know that our data is **by sensor/variable by vehicle by date** and that it is "de-duplicated" for compression purposes. As it turns out, because this is archieved and compressed data, our storing frame of mind is simply to store that data as a binary blob. But, lets make sure we are retrieving that blob per our use case. Our **use case is to retrieve data by airport by day and by vehicle**. That is, due to memory limitations that might exist, we want to retrieve our data in small enough partitions so that we can perform all of the functions neccessary to calculate fuel usage. So, we should be able to specifiy an airport and a date range, along with whatever variables are neccessary. That brings us to this basic table structure:

  * rowkey = airport::day::vin
  * column = variable
  * value = specific data.table

#####Create HBase Table
```{r, echo=FALSE}
hb.delete.table("Test")
```
```{r}
hostLoc = '127.0.0.1'  #Give your server IP
port = 9090  #Default port for thrift service
hb.init()
hb.list.tables()
TABLE_NAME = "Test"
COLUMN_FAMILY = "test"
hb.new.table(TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_FAMILY)
```

###Input Data into HBase
Now that we have our HBase table created, all that is left is actuall putting the `baggage_trucks` data into HBase. To do this, we will use the convenient `hb.put` function. There are a couple ways to do this, but given that all our information is contained in the name of the table, we can easily extract the rowkey and put it into a vector:
```{r}
require(magrittr)
require(tidyr)
dt_names <- names(baggage_trucks) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  tidyr::separate(".",c("airport","date","vin","variable"))
head(dt_names)
dt_names <- dt_names %>% unite(rowkey,airport,date,vin, sep = "::")
```

####How `hb.put` Works
The design of `hb.put` is ment to be relatively simple and flexible. For a given table and column family, you can either create a list of "columns" and a list of "values" for each "rowkey", or you insert it using a 1-1-1 ratio like this will do. Just fyi, the first option is very useful and designed for inputting multiple columns (think uncompressed time-series) into the same rowkey.

```{r}
hb.put(table_name = TABLE_NAME,column_family = COLUMN_FAMILY, rowkey = dt_names$rowkey, column = dt_names$variable,value = baggage_trucks)
```

And just like that **BAMMM*, data is in HBase. Now, just to pause for a second, it might be important that you understand how data was input in HBase, as this is actually a modification I made from the original rhbase package. The rowkeys are turned into byte arrays using the `charToRaw` method, essentially turning into a raw binary data type. The data.tables, and values by default, are turned into byte arrays using R's native serializer. If you would like to use your own serializer, input the data as raw (maybe because its already serialized), etc..., simply specify `sz = ` "raw", "character", or custom function in hb.put, OR specify it in the original `hb.init` function.



###puts them into hbase
input_hbase <- function(files, table, c.family,...){
  lapply(files,function(x){
    hb.put(table_name = table, column_family = c.family, rowkey = dt$rowkey, column = dt$column, value = dt$value,...)
    print(paste(x,"completed"))
  })
}

####send to hbase
time = Sys.time()
input_hbase(files, table = TABLE_NAME,c.family = COLUMN_FAMILY)
end = Sys.time()
end - time
####sweet, about 12 seconds to read and push

hb.init()
retrieved <- hb.pull(TABLE_NAME,COLUMN_FAMILY,batchsize = 10)
  
####testing to push back in
hb.put(TABLE_NAME, retrieved$column_family, rowkey = retrieved$rowkey, column = paste0(retrieved$column,"new"), value = retrieved$values)
  
####example retrieving only from 03/07/2014 onward for LAX
hb.pull(TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_FAMILY, start = "LAX::20140306", end = "LAXa",batchsize = 100)
  
####example retrieving everything between 03/03/2014 and 03/07/2014 (so nothin on the 7th)
hb.pull(TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_FAMILY, start = "LAX::20140304", end = "LAX::20140307",batchsize = 100)
