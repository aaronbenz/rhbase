#Part I: Intro to HBase
Welcome to a brief introduction to HBase by way of R. This tutorial aims to explain how you can use R through the `rhbase` package. It will use my custom addition to `rhbase` which is geared toward using `tidyr` principles and `data.tables`/`data.frames`. Other differences include:

1. Standardized row-key serializer (raw data type)
2. sz and usz functions only apply to the actual data instead of to row-key
3. hb.put - wrapper around hb.insert for easier inputting
4. hb.pull - wrapper around hb.scan for easier retrieval

The tutorial has three parts:

1. Installing HBase, Thrift, and `rhbase`, with a brief intro to HBase
2. Inserting data into HBase, and basic design/modeling 
3. Retrieving data from HBase, doing calculations, and inserting calculations

###What is HBase?
By no means will I attempt to explain all of HBase, but here is a brief attempt to summarize:

**Wikipedia definition**: HBase is an open source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's BigTable and written in Java. It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File system), providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.

**From the [Apache HBase website](http://hbase.apache.org/)**: “Use Apache HBase when you need **random, realtime read/write access** to your Big Data. This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- **billions of rows X millions of columns** -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase is an **open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database** modeled after Google's BigTable... Just as BigTable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase provides BigTable-like capabilities **on top of Hadoop and HDFS**.”

Clearly with those definitions you should know what HBase is now, right? If you're like me, a little more explanation is helpful. To start wrapping your head around NoSQL and HBase, here is a 5-step progression that I have found helpful:

1. A **Key-Value Store**
    - At its core, that's all HBase really is. It's a map, a dictionary (python), a hash (ruby), etc... 
2. **Distributed**
    - HBase sits atop a Hadoop cluster, meaning from HBase's perspective that the data in HBase is replicated out to, by default, 3 nodes in a Hadoop Cluster. 
    - Based on the assumption that servers go down and bad things happen
    - A full implementation relies on HDFS, Zookeeper, and your HBase region master(s)
3. **Consistent**
    - HBase is an immediately consistent database. That means that HBase guarantees your data to be exactly the same on all of the nodes that it is replicated to. 
    - See CAP Theorem for more information on Consistent, Available, and Partition tolerant databases (Cassandra is a similar NoSQL Columnar Database emphasizing Availability over Consistency)
4. **Sorted**
    - The Keys in this key-value store are stored alphabetically
    - Designed for faster reads than writes
    - Allows for fast "scanning" through keys
5. **Multi-Dimensional Key-Value Store**
    - It is a key-value store, but perhaps a better way to think about HBase's structure is a key-column-value store, or a Map of Maps
    - This is what is referred to as "columnar" or "wide rows"
    - For any given key, HBase allows you to store any amount of information
    - Schema-less - your key-column-value combination can be defined at any time and does not naturally conform to any schema


###HBase Frame of Mind
  - First there is a HBase **table**, which is exactly what you would think it is: a table
  - Within a table are **column families**, which are a subgroup of your table. Best practice is to limit the number and size of these. So, if you are new to HBase, just specify one column family, which is all that is necessary in many cases.
  - All data is then accessed via a **rowkey**, which is essentially your indexing mechanism (row-key or range of row-keys points directly to the correct data). This is also your key in "key-column-value" as depicted earlier
  - Within a given row, there can be potentially millions of columns. This is the concept of **wide rows**. Although many types of data lend themselves to columnar storage, time-series data in particular is a good use case:
    * Timestamps stored as column names
    * Variable value correlating to a particular timestamp in a cell
    * Variable name in the row key
    * This concept is often hard to grasp the first time, so I have provided some visuals to help explain it. Many people click on this concept when they realize that values are/can be stored as columns. 
  - **Schemaless**. You do not need to add columns in advance; you can do it on the fly. However, you should keep record or develop a scheme of how you are storing data as the actual retrieval will be very difficult if you have no idea what is in there.
  - Data modeling: **Based off query patterns and stored directly**. Cross-table joins are a BAD thing (Spark can help with this, but that does not mean you should design your data model to do any kind of joins). Essentially you are sacrificing complex querying for huge speed gains.

Hopefully that helped, and if not, there is plenty of information out there about HBase and what it does. Here are a few links:

- [Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/)
- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HBase)
- [Hortonworks](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hbase/)

###Installing HBase and `rhbase`
In order to use this stuff, you have to install HBase, Thrift, and the `rhbase` package. The basic instructions are [here](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki/user-rhbase-Home), but if you are trying to get up and running as soon as possible, here are a few helpful hints(change version numbers as needed):

1. Install Thrift following this [guide](http://Thrift.apache.org/docs/install/)
2. Update PKG_CONFIG_PATH: export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
3. Verify pkg-config path is correct: pkg-config --cflags Thrift , returns: -I/usr/local/include/Thrift
4. Copy Thrift library sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libThrift-0.8.0.so /usr/lib/
  - **Under this implementation I would advise using Thrift 0.8.0 as the latest version might include some bugs as it relates to this build**
5. Install HBase following Apache's quick start [guide](http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#quickstart)
6. Start up HBase and Thrift
```
[hbase-root]/bin/start-hbase.sh
[hbase-root]/bin/hbase Thrift start
```
7. Now download and install the package with devtools (or get a tarball copy [here](https://github.com/aaronbenz/rhbase/tree/master/pkg))
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aaronbenz/rhbase")
```

###Test it out
Provided HBase, Thrift, and `rhbase` are now installed correctly and are running, the code below should run successfully.
```{r}
library(rhbase)
library(data.table)
hb.init()
```

###Understanding Our Sample Data
The data that is supplied in this tutorial is simulated time-series data for airport support vehicles (such as baggage trucks) from various airports over a small period of time. The data is stored hierarchically as: Airport_Day_VehicleID_Variable. You can retrieve a list of all of the data simply by loading it from the `rhbase` package:
```{r}
data(baggage_trucks)
str(baggage_trucks[1:3])
```

The three variables are ***gear***, ***speed*** (mph), and **rpm** (revolutions per minute of engine). With these variables, the goal is to calculate the fuel rate of a vehicle. For more information about the data use `?baggage_trucks`.

Note: Credit to Spencer Herath for creating the sample data set of imaginary trucks whizzing around an invisible airport.

#Part II: Getting Data Into HBase with R

###HBase Table Design
It's important that the HBase table is designed to fit your query pattern(s) exactly. A NoSQL Columnar frame of mind is always ***Design Your Tables For Your Query Pattern***. Unlike a relational store, each table that is built is traditionally designed for one single type of query pattern (document stores like Solr or Elastic Search can offer a backwards indexing solution. Overall, this can make a data modeling experience "simpler" in concept). A good way to think about NoSQL is that **in one fetch, you want to retrieve all of the data neccessary to make a business decision**. To recap slightly, this frame of mind implies that:

  * Avoid joins completely if possible
  * Do as few lookups as possible
  * Do all data transformations on the incoming stream versus the outgoing
  
Remember, the goal is to get the data out and delivered as soon as possible, so take special precaution to ensure that the data and the query patterns are designed for the end format, not the raw format.

Currently the data in its raw format is **organized by variable, by vehicle, and by date.** Because this is archived data, additionally compression to a binary blob(byte array) is achievable. If properly done, it will drastically reduce the size of the data set and immensely increase the speed at which it is retrieved (because the dataset sits in just one blob as opposed to many cells). However, the approach should be sensitive to any memory limitations because the size and number of blobs have to be manageable. That is, data needs to be retrieved in manageable partitions that contain all of the necessary variables to perform a fuel usage calculation. With those concepts in mind, the query pattern should be able to take on specific airports and date ranges, along with whatever variables that are desired. Thus:

  * row-key = airport::day::vin
  * column = variable
  * value = specific data.table
  
![](HBaseDesign.png)


#####Create HBase Table
Now that the data model is defined, a table must be created to use it. In this case, we create a table called `Test` with a column family called `test`:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
hb.delete.table("Test")
```
```{r}
hostLoc = '127.0.0.1'  #Give your server IP
port = 9090  #Default port for Thrift service
hb.init()
hb.list.tables()
TABLE_NAME = "Test"
COLUMN_FAMILY = "test"
hb.new.table(TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_FAMILY)
```

###Input Data into HBase
Now that the HBase table is created, just put the `baggage_trucks` data into HBase. This can be done with the convenient `hb.put` function:
```{r}
require(magrittr, quietly = T)
require(tidyr, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)
data(baggage_trucks)
dt_names <- names(baggage_trucks) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  tidyr::separate(".",c("airport", "date", "vin", "variable"))
dt_names <- dt_names %>% unite(rowkey, airport, date, vin, sep = "::")
head(dt_names)
```

####How `hb.put` Works
The design of `hb.put` is meant to be simple and flexible. For a given table and column family, `hb.put` allows the creation of a list of "columns" and a list of "values" for each "row-key." This option is designed for inputting multiple columns into the same row-key (an uncompressed time-series use case). Additionally, `hb.put` allows the insertion of data using a 1-1-1 ratio like in this example:
```{r}
hb.put(table_name = TABLE_NAME,
       column_family = COLUMN_FAMILY,
       rowkey = dt_names$rowkey,
       column = dt_names$variable,
       value = baggage_trucks)
```


And just like that, data is in HBase. Before proceeding further, it is important to understand how data was put into HBase, as this is actually a modification from the original `rhbase` package. The row-keys are turned into byte arrays using the `charToRaw` method, converting the character row-key into a raw binary data type. The `data.table`s are turned into byte arrays using R's native serializer. If you would like to use your own serializer for the actual data(because it is already serialized, e.g.), input the data as raw by specifying `sz = ` "raw", "character", or custom function in `hb.put`, or specify it in the original `hb.init` function. Note: the row-key serializer is not editable at the moment. The change to this branch was separating the serialization method for the row-keys from the values.

  
####Examples of Retrieving Data
Now that data is inserted, here are some brief examples worth reviewing to understand how data can be retrieved from HBase with this package.

1. Retrieving only from 03/06/2014 onward for LAX and for just the "Speed" variable:
```{r}
hb.pull(TABLE_NAME,
        COLUMN_FAMILY,
        start = "LAX::20140306",
        end = "LAXa",
        columns = "speed",
        batchsize = 100)
```


2. Retrieving everything between the start of 03/07/2014 and the start of 03/08/2014:
```{r}
hb.pull(TABLE_NAME,
        COLUMN_FAMILY,
        start = "LAX::20140307",
        end = "LAX::20140308",
        batchsize = 100)
```


#Part III: Retrieve and Store
Okay, now that data is in HBase, let's:

1. **Retrieve data with `rhbase`**
2. **Manipulate data using `tidyr`, `data.table`, and `timeseriesr`**
3. **Perform calculations with `timeseriesr`**
4. **Store results using `rhbase`**



##Retrieving Data with `rhbase`
From the HBase input tutorial, we stored `data.table`s via byte arrays in HBase (from hbase_input document). But what about getting it out? By using `hb.pull`, we will be able to pull our desired HBase data.

Going back to the use case at hand, our goal is to measure the total fuel consumption of the trucks present in the data. To do so, we need to call gear, rpm, and speed (the three variables we put in HBase) and apply a custom fuel calculator in R. However, as mentioned previously, we need to be careful about how we bring data in, as too much data at one time could easily lead to memory problems.

Based on how we modeled our data, we are going to **retrieve ALL variables for ALL VINs by EACH day for EACH airport**. We can do this in HBase with the `scan` function. Recalling the description of HBase, all of the keys or row-keys are sorted alphabetically. This means that all of the data for one airport is stored contiguously. Additionally, because of our row-key structure, all of the data is sorted by Airport by Date. A scan operation will allow us to get back all of the data for one airport for one day in essentially one internal operation process(iop). That is, with one scan we can get all of the data because it's located in one block of rows. So how can we do this in R?

We begin with a list of our airports:
```{r}
airports <- c("JFK","LAX")
```
Then we create a list of all the dates we want, which in this case is between the 6th and 8th of March, 2014.
```{r}
start_dates <- paste0("2014030", 6:7)
end_dates <- paste0("2014030", 7:8)
```

Now let's create a function that will allow us to pull back all of the variables for one VIN, one Day at a time, to demonstrate responsible memory management.
```{r}
library(data.table)
rk_generator <- function(start, end, ...){
  function(x){
    data.table(start = paste(x,start, ...), end = paste(x,end,...))
  }
}

march <- rk_generator(start_dates, end_dates, sep = "::")
```

The functional `march` allows us to have all of the timestamps we want for each airport. For example:
```{r}
march(airports[1])
```

This output will feed our function to call HBase for each day for each airport. 


##Pull Data, Merge, and Calculate
1. Bring in some data for one day
2. Merge the data together to do a proper fuel calculation of `gal_per_hr`, average speed, and time in use
3. Visualize some of the results:

```{r}
a_day <- march(airports[1])[1]
```

Okay, time to bring in some data:
```{r}
library(rhbase)
library(magrittr)
hb.init()
data <- hb.pull("Test",
                "test",
                start = a_day[[1]],
                end = a_day[[2]],
                columns = c("gear","rpm","speed"))
data[1:6]
```

It's that simple.

##Manipulate Data with `tidyr`, `data.table`, and `timeseriesr`


Next let's do something with this data. Our goal is to combine the `gear`, `rpm`, and `speed` `data.table`s by `VIN`. To do this, we will:
1. Split the row key to make the values meaningful with `tidyr`
2. Combine `data.table`s with `VIN` in mind
3. Clean up merged data

1. Split with `tidyr`:
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  tidyr::separate(col = "rowkey", into = c("airport","day","vin"))
data[1:5]
```

2. Combine by `VIN` and column with `rbindlist`
```{r}
#rbind by variable
setkeyv(data, c("vin", "column"))

merge_em <- function(values){
  if(length(values)<=1) return(values)
  out <- values[[1]]
  for(i in 2:length(values)){
    out <- merge(out, values[[i]], all=T, by = "date_time")
  }
  out
}
data2 <- data[,list("rbinded" = list(merge_em(values))),
                    by=c("vin","day","airport")] #data.table functionality
data2$rbinded[[1]] %>% setDT
```
3. Clean up our data with `timeseriesr`. Because our timestamps for each variable were not guaranteed to match, we probably (and do) have NA values in each data set. This use of `dtreplace` will take any NA values and replace them with the last observation. 
```{r}
data2$rbinded <- data2$rbinded %>%
                 lapply(timeseriesr::dtreplace) %>%
                 lapply(setDT) #fills in missing NAs
data2$rbinded[[1]]
```
4. Now let's see what this looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
plot_time_series <- function(data_table,
                             time_variable = "time",
                             y = "value",
                             color_by = NULL,
                             facet_by = NULL,
                             facet_text_size = 10,
                             title = paste(data_table$well_id[1])){
    if(!is.null(facet_by))data_table$facet_by_this <- data_table[[facet_by]]
    col <- rainbow(30)
    col.index <- ifelse(seq(col) %% 2, 
                        seq(col), 
                        (seq(ceiling(length(col)/2),
                         length.out=length(col)) %% length(col)) + 1)
    mixed <- col[col.index]
    
    data_table[[time_variable]] <- as.POSIXct(data_table[[time_variable]], 
                                              origin = "1970-01-01")
    p <- ggplot(data_table,aes_string(time_variable ,y, color = color_by))+
        geom_step()+
        
        facet_grid(facet_by_this~., scales = "free") +
        labs(title = title, x = 'Time', y = '' ,size = 10)+
        
        theme(
            panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            plot.background = element_blank()) +
        theme(text = element_text(size=facet_text_size)) +
        scale_color_manual(values=rep(mixed, length.out=nrow(data_table)))
    return(p)
    
}
tmp <- tidyr::gather(data2$rbinded[[1]],
                     key = "variable",
                     value = "value",
                     -date_time)
plot_time_series(tmp,
                 time_variable = "date_time",
                 color_by = "variable",
                 facet_by = "variable")
```

####Perform our calculations with `timeseriesr`

3.Now that we have our data in memory, let's do our calculation! Below is a function to calculate `gal_per_hr` using our three variables (`rpm`, `gear`, and `speed`) 
```{r}
# I estimated this by looking at some relations between acceleration, 
# vehicle weight, torque, and all of the other things you see below on the magical world wide web
  
#calculates Fuel Usage by row, returns array of fuel usage
#engine power = torque * rpm / 5252
# The constant 5252 is the rounded value of (33,000 ft?lbf/min)/(2?? rad/rev).
# fuel usage: if Power < 0, alpha
#           : alpha + min(Pmax, engine power)
# alpha = constant idle fuel consumption rate 
#     (estimate of fuel sued to maintain engine operation)
# Pt = power = min(Pmax, torque + inertia(mass * radius^2))
gal_per_hr = function(engine_gear,
                      engine_rpm,
                      time,
                      speed,
                      alpha = .7,
                      mass = 10000,
                      gear_ratio = 1.2,
                      Pmax = 200,
                      efficiency_parameter = .02,
                      acceleration_parameter = .01,
                      wheel_radius){
    torque <- c(diff(engine_rpm),0)
    torque[torque<0] <- 0
    torque <- torque * engine_gear * gear_ratio
    Pt <- torque * engine_rpm / (33000/2/pi)
    Pt[Pt>200] <- 200
    engine_power <- t
    acceleration <- c(-diff(speed),0) / c(-diff(time),1) 
    #Pi = Mv(kg) * acceleration * velocity /1000
    fuel <- alpha +
            efficiency_parameter * Pt +
            acceleration_parameter * acceleration * mass*.45359/1000 * speed
    fuel[fuel < alpha] <- alpha
    fuel[is.nan(fuel)] <- alpha
    
    return(fuel)
}
```

Actually perform that operation
```{r}
data2$rbinded <- lapply(data2$rbinded,
                       function(i){
                           i$gal_per_sec <- gal_per_hr(engine_gear = i$gear,
                                                       engine_rpm = i$rpm,
                                                       speed = i$speed,
                                                       time = i$date_time)/60/60 
                                                       # currently in hours, but 
                                                       # want it to be in seconds 
                                                       # like the time column
                        i %>% setDT
                        })
data2$rbinded[[1]]
```
Now we have done our main calculation. But we want to know the total amount of gallons each truck burned per day. We are going to use `calc_area`, which is a `timeseriesr` function that calculates the area under the curve. It uses a Riemann left sum approach, but other methods may be added in the future.

```{r}
#calculates area under the curve as a total
data2$gallons <- data2$rbinded %>%
                 sapply(function(x)
                            timeseriesr::calc_area(time_date = x$date_time,
                                               value = x$gal_per_sec))
#calculates the total time range in hours (data is recorded in seconds)
data2$hours <- data2$rbinded %>%
               sapply(function(x)
                          (max(x$date_time) - min(x$date_time))/60/60)
#calculates the average speed
data2$mph <- data2$rbinded %>%
             sapply(function(x) mean(x$speed))
data2[,gal_per_hr := gallons/hours]
```
**We have now calculated the total number of gallons  each truck burned, the total hours it ran, miles per hour, and its average gallons per hour.** Now, let's put all of this back into HBase to move on to the day/airport. 

##Store Our Results Using `rhbase`
We are going to store all of the information that we collected back into the same HBase table for later use. That includes:
1. `rbind`ed `data.table` (because we might want to reuse it later)
2. gallons
3. total hours in operation
4. `gal_per_hr`
5. average mph

To do this we need to slightly reorganize our table to fit the `hb.put` standards. Nonetheless, the `tidyr` package allows us to do this with ease.
```{r}
#First, create rowkey with unite
data3 <- tidyr::unite(data2, "rowkey",airport:vin,sep = "::")

#Second, reoganize data with gather
data3 <- tidyr::gather(data3, column, value, -rowkey,convert = T)
data3[c(1,6,11,16,21)]
```

Great! Now that we have it in the format we want, let's put it back in HBase:
```{r}
#Assuming the hb.init connection is still valid
hb.put("Test",
       "test",
       rowkey = data3$rowkey,
       column = data3$column,
       value = data3$value)
```

And just to test it out, let's see what happens when we pull back one of the new columns we added:
```{r}
hb.pull("Test","test",c("gal_per_hr","rbinded"))
```

**Pretty cool!**

What is great about this is that you can easily parallelize this operation across multiple cores/nodes/clusters because we broke it down into intervals (airport and date). That is, our data model and query pattern were designed for easily doing a fork and join operation. Check out the `parallel` package or even the `rmr2` package for more details of how to do that. 

If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions please feel free to contact me. Also if you would like to further contribute to the `rhbase` fork or `timeseriesr` package, all contributions are welcome.
