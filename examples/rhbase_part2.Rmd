title: "Retrieving from HBase with R"
output: pdf_document

This document serves as a tutorial for pulling data from HBase, doing some calculations on it, and storing the results back into HBase

**Note:** This example will be using the rhbase version provided by Aaron Benz, originally forked from Revo R's repo on github. For more information check out github.com/aaronbenz

**Assumption:** Followed previous example so that HBase and thrift are running, rhbase is installed, and data is available.

Ok, so now that data is in HBase, lets:

1. **Retrieve Data with rhbase**
2. **Manipulate Data using Tidyr + data.table + timeseriesr**
3. **Perform Calculations with timeseriesr**
4. **Store Our Results using rhbase**



##Retrieving Data with rhbase
From the HBase input tutorial, we stored data.tables via byte arrays in HBase (from hbase_input document). By using hb.pull, we will be able to pull our desired HBase data. But what do we want to pull?

The fake data is from Airport Support Vehicles (like a baggage truck), and our goal is to measure their total fuel consumption. To do so, we are calling in gear, rpm, and speed (the three variables we put in HBase), so that we can apply a custom made fuel calculator in R. But lets be careful about how we bring this in, as too much data could easily lead to memory problems.

Currently, each variable is stored in a column. The concatenation of the airport, the day of the occurrence, and the vehicle identification number (VIN) make the row key that points directly to all our variables. As mentioned earlier, depending on the size of your data, there are other ways to model your data. For our sake, we loaded  compressed data which might have originated in a live streaming model that is much different. OK, so back to retrieving data... Based on how we modeled our data (sorry for the overkill, but it SHOULD ALWAYS be based on our retrieval patterns in a NoSQL Columnar store), we are going to **retrieve ALL variables for ALL VINs by EACH day for EACH airport**. 

In some other metadata table, there should have been a description of what airports are available. We are dealing with 2:
```{r}
airports <- c("JFK","LAX")
```
Additionally, we know we want all dates between the 6th and 8th of March 2014.
```{r}
start_dates <- paste0("2014030", 6:7)
end_dates <- paste0("2014030", 7:8)
```

Now lets create a function that will pull back all of the variables 1 VIN 1 Day at a time (this is done to demonstrate responsible memory management.)
```{r}
library(data.table)
scan_rk_generator <- function(start, end, ...){
  function(x){
    data.table(start = paste(x,start, ...), end = paste(x,end,...))
  }
}

march <- scan_rk_generator(start_dates, end_dates, sep = "::")
```



Now our functional `march` allows us to have all of the time stamps we want for each airport. For example:
```{r}
march(airports[1])
```

Don't you just love how easy R is? This output will feed our function to call HBase for each day for each airport. But before we start bringing data in, lets make sure we know what we are doing once we have it... aka, lets make a fuel calculation based off of the some general information given about cars (YES, if you had a variable called fuel calculation, this would be a great time to do some actual regression analysis and apply it to all of your other airports and trucks. We are gonna assume that I came up with that magical formula).


##Pull data, merge, and calculate
OK, so now that we have our calculation, lets:
1. Bring in some data for 1 day
2. Merge the data together to do a proper fuel calculation of `gal_per_hr`, average speed, and time in use
3. Visualize some of the results

```{r}
a_day <- march(airports[1])[1]
```

OK, time to bring in some data
```{r}
library(rhbase)
library(magrittr)
hb.init()
data <- hb.pull("Test","test",start = a_day[[1]], end = a_day[[2]], columns = c("gear","rpm","speed"))
data[1:6]
```

WHOAAAA, dataaaaa!!!!! So whats this stuff actually look like?

##Manipulate Data with Tidyr + data.table + timeseriesr


OK, lets do something with that stuff. Our goal is this: to combine the gear, rpm, and speed data.tables by VIN. Our basic steps to doing so:
1. Split the row key to make the values meaningful with tidyr
2. Combine data.tables with VIN in mind
3. Clean up merged data

1. Split with tidyr
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  tidyr::separate(col = "rowkey", into = c("airport","day","vin"))
data[1:5]
```

2. Combine by vin + column with rbindlist
```{r}
#rbind by variable
setkeyv(data, c("vin", "column"))

merge_em <- function(values){
  if(length(values)<=1) return(values)
  out <- values[[1]]
  for(i in 2:length(values)){
    out <- merge(out,values[[i]],all=T,by = "date_time")
  }
  out
}
data2 <- data[,list("rbinded" = list(merge_em(values))),by=c("vin","day","airport")] #data.table functionality
data2$rbinded[[1]] %>% setDT
```
3. Clean up our data with timeseriesr. Essentially, because our time stamps for each variable were not guaranteed to match, we probably (and do) have NA values in each data set. This use of `dtreplace` will take any NA values and replace them with the Last Observation. 
```{r}
data2$rbinded <- data2$rbinded %>% lapply(timeseriesr::dtreplace)  %>% lapply(setDT)#fills in missing NAs
data2$rbinded[[1]]
```
4. Now lets see what this baby looks like:
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
plot_time_series <- function(data_table, time_variable = "time", y = "value", color_by = NULL, facet_by = NULL,facet_text_size = 10,title = paste(data_table$well_id[1])){
    if(!is.null(facet_by))data_table$facet_by_this <- data_table[[facet_by]]
    col <- rainbow(30)
    col.index <- ifelse(seq(col) %% 2, 
                        seq(col), 
                        (seq(ceiling(length(col)/2), length.out=length(col)) %% length(col)) + 1)
    mixed <- col[col.index]
    
    data_table[[time_variable]] <- as.POSIXct(data_table[[time_variable]], origin = "1970-01-01")
    p <- ggplot(data_table,aes_string(time_variable ,y, color = color_by))+
        geom_step()+
        
        facet_grid(facet_by_this~., scales = "free") +
        labs(title = title, x = 'Time', y = '' ,size = 10)+
        
        theme(
            panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
            panel.background = element_blank(),
            plot.background = element_blank()) +
        theme(text = element_text(size=facet_text_size)) +
        scale_color_manual(values=rep(mixed, length.out=nrow(data_table)))
    return(p)
    
}
tmp <- tidyr::gather(data2$rbinded[[1]],key = "variable",value = "value",-date_time)
plot_time_series(tmp, time_variable = "date_time",color_by = "variable", facet_by = "variable")
```
####Perform our calculations with timeseriesr

3.Now lets do our calculation!!! Below is the a function that will be used to calculate the gal_per_hr from our 3 variables (rpm, gear, and speed)
```{r}
#I basically estimated this by looking at some relations between acceleration, vehicle weight, torque, and all of the other things you see below on the magical world wide web
  
#calculates Fuel Usage by row, returns array of fuel usage
#engine power = torque * rpm / 5252
# The constant 5252 is the rounded value of (33,000 ft?lbf/min)/(2?? rad/rev).
#fuel usage: if Power < 0, alpha
#           : alpha + min(Pmax, engine power)
# alpha = constant idle fuel consumption rate (estimate of fuel sued to maintain engine operation)
# Pt = power = min(Pmax, torque + inertia(mass * radius^2))
gal_per_hr = function(engine_gear, engine_rpm, time, speed, alpha = .7, mass = 10000, gear_ratio = 1.2, Pmax =   200, efficiency_parameter = .02, acceleration_parameter = .01, wheel_radius){
    torque <- c(diff(engine_rpm),0)
    torque[torque<0] <- 0
    torque <- torque * engine_gear * gear_ratio
    Pt <- torque * engine_rpm / (33000/2/pi)
    Pt[Pt>200] <- 200
    engine_power <- t
    acceleration <- c(-diff(speed),0) / c(-diff(time),1) 
    #Pi = Mv(kg) * acceleration * velocity /1000
    fuel <- alpha + efficiency_parameter * Pt + acceleration_parameter * acceleration * mass*.45359/1000 * speed
    fuel[fuel < alpha] <- alpha
    fuel[is.nan(fuel)] <- alpha
    
    return(fuel)
}
```

Actually perform that operation
```{r}
data2$rbinded <- lapply(data2$rbinded,function(i){
                        i$gal_per_sec <- gal_per_hr(engine_gear = i$gear, engine_rpm = i$rpm, speed = i$speed, time = i$date_time)/60/60 #currently in hours, but want it to be in seconds as the time column is in seconds
                        i %>% setDT
                        })
data2$rbinded[[1]]
```
Sweeeeeet!!! So now we have done our main calculation. But we want to know the total amount of gallons each truck burned per day. We are going to use `calc_area`, which is a timeseriesr function that essentially calculates the area under the curve. It is simply using Riemann left sum approach, but others will probably be added soon enough (if your data is compressed and de-duplicated then its the right approach)
```{r}
#calculates area under the curve as a total
data2$gallons <- data2$rbinded %>%
                        sapply(function(x) timeseriesr::calc_area(time_date = x$date_time, value = x$gal_per_sec))
#calculates the total time range in hours (data is recorded in seconds)
data2$hours <- data2$rbinded %>%
                        sapply(function(x) (max(x$date_time) - min(x$date_time))/60/60)
#calculates the average speed
data2$mph <- data2$rbinded %>%
                        sapply(function(x) mean(x$speed))
data2[,gal_per_hr := gallons/hours]
```
**Bada Bing Bada Boom aka BBBB**. We have now calculated the total amount of gallons that each truck burned, the total hours it ran, miles per hour, and its average gallons per hour. Now, lets put all of this back into HBase to move onto the day/airport. 

##Store Our Results using rhbase
We are going to store all of the information that we collected back into the same HBase table for later use. That includes:
1. rbinded data.table (cause we might want to reuse it later)
2. gallons
3. total hours in operation
4. gal_per_hr
5. average mph

To do this we need to slightly reorganize our table (hopefully in the future I/someone will add a small wrapper to take care of this) to fit the `hb.put` standards. None the less `tidyr` package allows us to do this with ease.
```{r}
#First, create rowkey with unite
data3 <- tidyr::unite(data2, "rowkey",airport:vin,sep = "::")

#Second, reoganize data with gather
data3 <- tidyr::gather(data3, column, value, -rowkey,convert = T)
data3[c(1,6,11,16,21)]
```

Great!!! Now that we have it in the format we want, lets put it back in HBase
```{r}
#Assuming the hb.init connection is still valid
hb.put("Test","test",rowkey = data3$rowkey, column = data3$column, value = data3$value)
```

And just to test it out, lets see what happens when we pull back one of the new columns we added
```{r}
hb.pull("Test","test",c("gal_per_hr","rbinded"))
```

**BBBB!!!** Pretty cool right? 

Whats great about this is that you can easily parallel this operation across multiple cores/nodes/clusters because we broke it down in intervals (airport and date). Check out the rparallel package or even the rmr2 package for more details of how to do that. 

If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions please feel free to contact me. Also if you would like to further contribute to the rhbase fork or timeseriesr package, I welcome all aboard.
